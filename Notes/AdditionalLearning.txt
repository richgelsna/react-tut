This document is to keep track of everything that I DON'T know, and which requires research seperate from the tutorial.
- CSS, CSS Classes, and Bootstrap
- I could do some additional studying on HTML tags, and ES6 syntax beyond what is taught in the course.


Resolved Questions:
- Look up the "let" keyword in js.... is this and "const" the only (proper) way to declare vars?
    - What's the difference between this syntax, and declaring something like "state = {}" in a class?
        - "let" sets the scope to "block" level... using "let" in a method means you can only access that var from that method.
        - Not using "let" sets it to a global scope... I still don't know how this interacts with JS classes.

        - In classes, it seems when you declare an object, it's local to the class, even without "let" keywords.
            - Remember, classes are a declaration (prototype) of an object, rather than an instantiation, so that seems to change the rules lol...

    - Furthermore, in the "state" object, sometimes you see additional "objects"/vars being declared with a different syntax:
        state = { count: 0, tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]}
        ... what's with that?
        - state is an object with additional properties.  It's kind of like declaring an instatiated version of a class (an object),
            without there being a formal class that fits that object's model.  So, you're more or less declaring the class and object at the same time
            (I think)... This also runs in-lieu of "JavaScript Object Notation", aka JSON.
        - The object simply doesn't get a formal prototype, or Class definition.
